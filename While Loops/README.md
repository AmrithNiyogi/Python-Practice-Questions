## While Loops
1. **Sum of Natural Numbers:** Write a program that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a while loop.
2. **Factorial Calculation:** Create a program that computes the factorial of a given number using a while loop.
3. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a while loop.
4. **Guessing Game:** Implement a simple guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program should provide feedback whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses correctly.
5. **Reverse Digits:** Write a program that takes an integer as input and reverses its digits using a while loop.
6. **Sum of Digits:** Create a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer using a while loop.
7. **Collatz Conjecture:** Implement the Collatz conjecture sequence. Starting with a positive integer `n`, repeatedly apply the rule: `n = n / 2` if `n` is even, and `n = 3n + 1` if `n` is odd, until `n` becomes 1.
8. **User Authentication:** Simulate a simple user authentication process. Prompt the user to enter a password and keep asking until they enter the correct password (predefined in the code).
9. **Prime Number Check:** Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using a while loop.
10. **Countdown Timer:** Implement a countdown timer that starts from a user-defined number of seconds and counts down to zero, displaying each second.
11. **Finding GCD:** Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm with a while loop.
12. **Digit Frequency:** Create a program that takes a number as input and counts the frequency of each digit using a while loop.
13. **Decimal to Binary Conversion:** Write a program that converts a decimal number to its binary representation using a while loop.
14. **Sum of Even Numbers:** Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and `n` (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a while loop.
15. **Palindrome Check:** Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome using a while loop.
16. **Sum of Series:** Write a program that calculates the sum of the series `1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n` (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a while loop.
17. **Finding Square Root:** Implement a program that calculates the square root of a number using the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method) with a while loop.
18. **Removing Zeros:** Create a program that removes all zeroes from a given number using a while loop.
19. **Binary Search:** Implement a binary search algorithm using a while loop to find a target number in a sorted list.
20. **Repeating a Message:** Write a program that asks the user for a message and a number `n`, then prints the message `n` times using a while loop.

This repository contains Python practice questions to help you improve your programming skills. The questions are categorized into Basic Operations, Conditional Statements, For Loops, and While Loops. Each category includes a variety of problems designed to cover fundamental programming concepts.

## Basic Operations


## Conditional Statements

## For Loops

## While Loops


## List-Based Questions


## Tuple-Based Questions
#### 1. Creating and Accessing Tuples:
- Create a tuple named `person` with the elements `"Alice"`, `30`, and `"Engineer"`.
- Access the second element in the `person` tuple.
#### 2. Tuple Immutability:
- Explain why tuples are immutable with an example.
- Attempt to change the first element of `person` and observe the result.
#### 3. Nested Tuples:
- Create a tuple that contains two tuples: `tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)`.
- Access the element `5` from the nested tuple.
#### 4. Tuple Unpacking:
- Given `colors = ("red", "green", "blue")`, unpack the elements into three variables.
- Write a function that returns a tuple with three elements, and unpack these elements when calling the function.
#### 5. Returning Tuples from Functions:
- Write a function `min_max` that takes a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values.
- Call `min_max` with a sample list and print the results.
#### 6. Swapping Variables:
- Use tuple unpacking to swap the values of two variables `a` and `b`.
- Demonstrate the swap operation with `a = 5` and `b = 10`.
#### 7. Tuples in Dictionaries:
- Create a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing coordinates, and the values are city names.
- Access the city name at the coordinate `(1, 2)`.
#### 8. Tuples in Lists:
- Create a list of tuples, each containing a student name and their grade.
- Iterate through the list and print each student's name and grade.
#### 9. Tuple Comprehensions:
- Write a generator expression that creates tuples of numbers and their squares for numbers 1 to 5.
- Convert the generator expression to a tuple.
#### 10. Tuple Methods:
- Given `fruit_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple")`, count how many times `"apple"` appears.
- Find the index of `"cherry"` in the tuple.
#### 11. Using Tuples for Multiple Return Values:
- Write a function that takes a string and returns a tuple containing the string in uppercase, lowercase, and its length.
- Call the function and print the results.
#### 12. Tuple as Function Arguments:
- Write a function that takes a tuple of three elements and prints them.
- Call the function with a tuple `("A", "B", "C")`.
#### 13. Immutable Data Structures:
- Explain why using tuples can be beneficial for creating immutable data structures.
- Provide an example where using a tuple would be more appropriate than a list.
#### 14. Zipping Lists into Tuples:
- Given two lists `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = ["a", "b", "c"]`, use the `zip` function to create a list of tuples.
- Iterate over the zipped list and print each tuple.
#### 15. Tuples with Different Data Types:
- Create a tuple containing a string, a number, and a list: `("Python", 3.8, [1, 2, 3])`.
- Access and print each element in the tuple.

# Python Practice Questions

This repository contains Python practice questions to help you improve your programming skills. The questions are categorized into various topics covering fundamental programming concepts and more advanced features of Python. Each section includes a variety of problems with increasing complexity.

## Categories

- **[Basic Operations](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/Basic%20Operation)**: Questions to get you started with simple arithmetic, string manipulation, and basic input/output operations.
  
- **[Conditional Statements](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/Conditionals)**: Problems to help you understand `if`, `elif`, `else` conditions and logical operators.

- **[For Loops](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/For%20Loops)**: Practice looping through sequences and applying logic in iteration.
  
- **[While Loops](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/While%20Loops)**: Questions on how to use loops effectively with condition checks.
  
- **[List-Based Questions](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/Lists)**: Practice manipulating Python lists (arrays) through indexing, slicing, and applying common list methods.
  
- **[Tuple-Based Questions](https://github.com/AmrithNiyogi/Python-Practice-Questions/tree/main/Tuples)**: Solve problems involving tuples, an immutable type of sequence.

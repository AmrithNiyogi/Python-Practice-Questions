## For Loops
1. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Write a program that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a for loop.
2. **Calculate Compound Interest**: Write a program that calculates the compound interest for a principal amount, rate of interest, and time period provided by the user.
3. **Merge Two Lists**: Create a program that merges two lists provided by the user into a single sorted list without duplicates.
4. **Find Maximum in List**: Write a program that finds the maximum number in a list of integers using a for loop.
5. **Sum of Digits**: Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer using a for loop.
6. **Multiplication Table**: Generate a multiplication table for a number (user input) up to 10 using a for loop.
7. **Prime Numbers up to `n`**: Write a program that prints all prime numbers up to `n` (where `n` is a user-provided input) using a for loop.
8. **Finding Common Elements**: Write a program that finds the common elements between two lists using a for loop.
9. **Nested Loops for Patterns**: Write a program that prints a pyramid pattern of stars with `n` levels using nested for loops.
10. **Flatten a List of Lists**: Write a program that flattens a list of lists into a single list using a for loop.
11. **Matrix Addition**: Write a program that adds two matrices (represented as lists of lists) using nested for loops.
12. **Histogram**: Create a program that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen using a for loop.
13. **Iterating Over a Dictionary**: Write a program that iterates over a dictionary and prints each key and value using a for loop.
14. **Transpose a Matrix**: Write a program that transposes a given matrix (represented as a list of lists) provided by the user.
15. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**: Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers provided by the user.
16. **Calculate the Harmonic Sum**: Write a program that calculates the harmonic sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is provided by the user.
17. **Check for Pythagorean Triplet**: Write a Python program that checks if three numbers provided by the user form a Pythagorean triplet.
18. **Find All Subsets of a List**: Write a program to find and print all subsets of a list of integers provided by the user.
19. **Matrix Diagonal Sum**: Write a program to calculate the sum of the diagonals of a square matrix provided by the user.
20. **String Compression**: Write a program that performs basic string compression by counting consecutive characters (e.g., "aaabb" becomes "a3b2").

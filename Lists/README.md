## List based questions
#### 1. Creating and Modifying Lists:
- Create a list named `cities` with the elements `"New York"`, `"London"`, `"Paris"`.
- Add `"Tokyo"` to the end of the `cities` list.
- Insert `"Sydney"` at the second position in the `cities` list.
#### 2. List Indexing and Slicing:
- Given `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, print the third element.
- Print the last two elements using slicing.
- Print every second element in the list.
#### 3. List Comprehensions:
- Create a list comprehension that generates a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 15.
- Generate a list of even numbers between 1 and 20 using list comprehension.
#### 4. List Methods:
- Given `animals = ["cat", "dog", "rabbit", "elephant"]`, sort the list alphabetically.
- Reverse the order of elements in the `animals` list.
- Remove the element `"rabbit"` from the list.
#### 5. Iterating Through Lists:
- Write a for loop that prints each element in the list `countries = ["USA", "UK", "France", "Germany"]`.
- Use a while loop to iterate through and print each element in `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
#### 6. Nested Lists:
- Create a 2x3 matrix using nested lists where each element is 1.
- Write a function `print_matrix(matrix)` to print the matrix row by row.
#### 7. List Functions:
- Write a function `find_min` that takes a list of numbers and returns the smallest number.
- Write a function `sum_list` that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum.
#### 8. Combining and Splitting Lists:
- Combine two lists `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [4, 5, 6]` into a single list.
- Split the list `sentence = "This is a test sentence"` into individual words using the split method.
#### 9. List Comprehension with Conditions:
- Create a list comprehension that generates a list of odd numbers between 1 and 20.
- Create a list comprehension that filters out negative numbers from `nums = [-5, 3, -1, 101, -10, 22]`.
#### 10. Modifying List Elements:
- Given `items = ["pen", "pencil", "paper"]`, change `"pencil"` to `"eraser"`.
- Double each element in the list `values = [2, 4, 6, 8]` and store the results in a new list.
#### 11. Finding Elements in Lists:
- Write a function `contains(element, lst)` that returns `True` if `element` is in `lst`, else `False`.
- Write a function `index_of(element, lst)` that returns the index of `element` in `lst` or `-1` if not found.
#### 12. List of Tuples:
- Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its square, for numbers 1 to 5.
- Write a function `sum_of_first_elements(tuples)` that returns the sum of the first elements of each tuple.
#### 13. Removing Duplicates:
- Write a function `remove_duplicates(lst)` that takes a list and returns a new list with duplicates removed.
- Given `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4]`, use the function to remove duplicates.
#### 14. Advanced List Comprehensions:
- Create a list of tuples containing each letter in `word = "hello"` and its corresponding ASCII value.
- Create a flattened list from a list of lists `nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]`.
#### 15. List to String and Vice Versa:
- Write a function `list_to_string(lst)` that takes a list of strings and joins them into a single string separated by commas.
- Write a function `string_to_list(s)` that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns a list of words.
